This project analyzes and compares multiple regression models on the California Housing dataset to predict median house prices. The assignment focuses on data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation using MSE, MAE, and R², and improving performance through k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. The code is implemented in Python using scikit-learn and can be run by installing the required libraries, opening the Jupyter Notebook, and executing all cells. The results show that ensemble models, particularly Random Forest, provide the best predictive performance and generalization.
