This project focuses on applying and comparing various regression techniques to predict median house prices using the California Housing dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset is first loaded and converted into a pandas DataFrame, followed by essential preprocessing steps such as checking for missing values and performing feature scaling using standardization to ensure fair contribution of all features, especially for scale-sensitive models. Multiple regression algorithms—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor—are implemented to understand their working principles and suitability for real-world housing data. Each model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) score to measure prediction accuracy and model performance. The results are compared to identify the best-performing and worst-performing models, with ensemble methods generally showing superior performance due to their ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships. The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and is well-documented, ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and compliance with the assignment requirements.
