This project focuses on predicting car prices in the US automobile market using machine learning regression techniques. The objective is to identify key factors influencing car prices and build predictive models that help a Chinese automobile company understand US pricing dynamics before entering the market. The dataset was preprocessed by handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding, removing irrelevant features, and scaling data where required. Five regression models were implemented: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Among all models, Gradient Boosting Regressor delivered the best performance, effectively capturing non-linear relationships. Feature importance analysis revealed that engine size, curb weight, horsepower, and car dimensions are the most influential factors affecting car prices. Hyperparameter tuning further improved model accuracy. This project provides valuable insights into car pricing behavior and supports data-driven decision-making for market entry strategies.
