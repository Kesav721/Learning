This project focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset was preprocessed through feature scaling to ensure fair model comparison. Five classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—were implemented and evaluated using accuracy and classification reports. The results show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best overall performance, demonstrating its effectiveness on high-dimensional medical data, while the Decision Tree classifier performed comparatively lower due to overfitting tendencies.
